# Automatic-Sentence-Completion-using-NLP
This project showcases an intelligent system for automatic sentence completion using a pre-trained GPT-2 model, enhanced with Speech-to-Text input. The core functionality is driven by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enabling dynamic text generation that predicts and completes sentences based on user input.

#Key Features:
*Text & Speech Input: Users can input text manually or utilize real-time speech recognition to convert spoken language into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
*Advanced GPT-2 Prediction: The pre-trained GPT-2 model generates highly contextual sentence completions. Given a few initial words, the model suggests the next logical set of words, helping automate content creation and conversation flow.
*Streamlined User Interface: Built using Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive and modern UI with input method selection, word prediction limits, and easy-to-use buttons.
*Real-Time Speech-to-Text: Utilize your microphone to speak and let the app transcribe and predict the completion of your sentence, all in one seamless process.

#Technologies Used:
*Hugging Face Transformers: For utilizing the GPT-2 model for text generation.
*Streamlit: To build a modern, interactive, and easy-to-use interface.
*SpeechRecognition: To handle voice input, converting speech into text for the NLP model.
*TensorFlow: Backend framework for model handling.

#Use Cases:
*Content Generation: Automates sentence completions for writers, bloggers, and content creators, accelerating the process of writing.
*Assistive Communication: Aids individuals in formulating responses, enhancing productivity in messaging and emails.
*NLP Research: A base project for research in sentence generation, predictive modeling, and the study of language models.

#Future Enhancements:
*Enhanced Speech-to-Text Models: Integrating more robust ASR systems to improve accuracy and speed.
*Multilingual Support: Extending the model to support sentence completions in various languages.
*Model Fine-tuning: Offering customizable fine-tuning options for domain-specific text generation.
